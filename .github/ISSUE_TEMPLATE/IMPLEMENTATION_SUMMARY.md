# Issue Templates Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation addresses the issue "Simplifique solicita√ß√µes de mudan√ßa para professores" by creating a comprehensive set of GitHub issue templates that enable teachers to request changes without needing to directly modify code or understand technical details.

## Problem Statement

Teachers at Mergington High School:
- Don't feel comfortable modifying the program directly

## Key Features of All Templates

### 1. **Structured Information Collection**
- Required and optional fields clearly marked
- Dropdowns for standardized options
- Text areas for detailed descriptions
- Checkboxes for multi-select options

### 2. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**
Each template includes specific criteria defining when the task is complete:
- Functional requirements met
- Data persisted correctly
- Tests passing
- No regression in existing functionality

### 3. **Technical Guidance for Copilot Agent**
Every template provides:
- **Files to modify:** Exact paths to relevant source files
- **Code patterns:** Example implementations following project conventions
- **Validations needed:** Business rules and data integrity checks
- **Architecture principles:** Clean Architecture layer responsibilities

### 4. **Automatic Assignment**
All templates automatically assign `@copilot` to ensure the coding agent is notified immediately.

### 5. **Proper Labeling**
Templates use appropriate labels for:
- Category (enhancement, bug)
- Feature area (atividade, inscri√ß√£o, ui/ux, etc.)
- Type (feature-request, frontend, data)

## Additional Documentation
